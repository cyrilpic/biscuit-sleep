# External code

This folder contains code from other repositories that has been customized either to fix a bug or to match some different requirements. Compatibility with the latest version of these libraries is not guaranteed. They may or may not end up being pushed upstream. For copyright and license information, please refer to the original work.

Changes are documented at the top of each file. To ensure that MATLAB uses these scripts instead of the original, these folders must be added to MATLAB's path AFTER the original libraries.
