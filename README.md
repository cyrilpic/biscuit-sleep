# biscuit-sleep

Every body needs a good cookie.

`Biscuit-sleep` is a collections of MATLAB functions and scripts for the quantification of stroke lesions from segmented MRI images and the processing of EEG data from sleep. It adds some tools on top of:
* [EEGLAB](https://github.com/sccn/eeglab)
* [csc-eeg-tools](https://github.com/CSC-UW/csc-eeg-tools)
* [swa-matlab]()
* [ept_TFCE-matlab]()
* [SPM12]()

The code in `external` contains customizations of functions from these repositories. For these customizations to be taken up by MATLAB, `biscuit-sleep` should be added to the path after its dependencies.

The code is provided as is. Contributions are welcome.
